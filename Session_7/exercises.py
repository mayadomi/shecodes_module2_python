# Q1 Create a class to represent She Codes Students. 
# Attributes that you may want toinclude:
#Name
#Program attended ("Plus" or "Flash")
#Year they attended

# class Students:

#     def __init__(self, name, program, year) -> None:
#         self.name = name
#         self.program = program
#         self.year = year

# Q2Add a __str__ method to your student class that returns a summary 
# of the student'sinformation.For a student named Olivia who attended Plus 
# in 2019, it should look like:"<Student: Olivia, Program: Plus, Year: 2019>"

# class Student:

#     def __init__(self, name, program, year) -> None:
#         self.name = name
#         self.program = program
#         self.year = year
    
#     def __str__(self) -> str:
#         return f"Student: {self.name}, Program: {self.program}, Year: {self.year}"
    

# student1 = Student(name="Olivia", program="Plus", year="2019")
# print(student1)

# Q3 Write a class that represents a rectangle shape and has a method for 
# each of the following:
# Calculating the area.
# Calculating the perimeter.
# Calculating the length of the diagonal.
# Determining whether or not the rectangle is a square.
# Hereâ€™s the initialiser method to help get you started:
import math
