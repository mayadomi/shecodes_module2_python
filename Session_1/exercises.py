# Q1 - Write a program that takes two numbers from the user,and outputs their sum

# first_number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# second_number = int(input("Enter another number: "))

# print(f"The sum of your numbers is {first_number + second_number}")

# Q2: Write a program that takes two numbers from the user,and outputs the equation 
# representing the multiplication ofthe two numbers.

# first_number = input("Enter a number: ")
# second_number = input("Enter another number: ")

# print(f"To multiple your numbers I'd do this equation: {first_number} * {second_number} = {int(first_number)* int(second_number)}")


# Q3: Write a program that takes a distance in kilometers fromthe user, 
# and output the distance in meters and centimeters.

# kilometres =  float(input("Enter number of kilometers: "))

# print(f"The distance in metres is {kilometres*1000}m")
# print(f"The distance in centimetres is {kilometres*100000}cm")

# Q4: Write a program that takes the user's name and height(in centimeters), and outputs a summary sentence.

user_name = input("What is your name? ")
user_height = input("What is your height in centimetres? ")

print(f"{user_name} is {user_height}cm tall.")

#Q5: Is the input function a statement or an expression?

# I think it's a statement.... as it's asserting/gathering an assignment of value, 
# rather than calculating/composing an output... though it could be used as part of an expression.
